 Fake News Detection Using NLP ðŸ§ 

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to detect whether a news article is **real** or **fake**, based on its title and content.

 Built with `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `TF-IDF`, and `Logistic Regression`

 Project Overview

- âœ… Loaded real & fake news datasets
- âœ… Preprocessed text with custom cleaning function
- âœ… Vectorized using **TF-IDF**
- âœ… Trained **Logistic Regression** model
- âœ… Achieved **98.7% accuracy**
- âœ… Saved model and vectorizer for future predictions
